/*
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]




Example 1:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:

Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.


Note:

All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.

/*
 #### 解题思路
 - 如果p,q都小于当前节点，说明在当前节点的左子树
 - 如果p,q都大于当前节点，说明在当前节点的右子树
 - 如果一个大一个小，说明当前节点即为公共祖先节点
